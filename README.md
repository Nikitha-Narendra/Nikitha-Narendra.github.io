MUSIC

Introduction
Music is an implicit part of our life. It has the power to make or break a mood, inspire a change, or make you feel like the star of a music video. Music is a common language. It speards across multiple cultures, societies and genres.
A study conducted in 2011 [1], showed that mood and performance directly correlate with music. Infact a viral trend started that used mario-kart theme song to help increase the speed of your work, while slow tunes help you focus longer. Multiple studies [2] conducted over years all point to a single concusion "Music directly affect you".
So when you're studying for ML and need music to be creative or need music to finish the assignment fast, you need a perfect playlist. But, creating a playlist can take a while. This is where music recommendation system can help. Spotufy, a MRS giant, is know for its music recommendation. Spotify uses a host of algorithms to determine what kind of music an idividual may like [3]. They use user interactivity and collaborative filtering to recommend songs.
But does this provide the best recommendations or just a set of songs you may or may not like? A study conducted in 2018[4] highlights some of the issues with this kind of recommendation systems. Another paper provides a critical analysis of MRS [5]. Once of the issues highlighed is situational recommendation.
Say you are listening to relaxational music while doing ML Assignment, this is a passive activity where music in your playlist autoplays songs while you work. What if you dont have a playlist or found one song that you like and forgot to add more to the queue. How should the nect song be decided? Classic MRS find any song that you may like and play it, this may or may not be a relaxational music but still may be a song that you enjoy. But this random selection disturbs your mood and thereby affect your performace.
